# Predicting Boston Housing Prices

The Boston Housing Dataset consists of prices of houses in various places in Boston. The dataset is described by information such as Crime rate (CRIM), Nitric Oxide concentration (NOX), Age of the house owners (AGE), etc. Head over to [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing/data) to get detailed explanation of other attributes of the dataset and also download it.

Our goal is to predict the prices of houses in Boston using this dataset. As you can already guess, this is a Linear Regression problem since we were given both the input and target labels.
